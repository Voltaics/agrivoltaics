## Project Abstract
The AI Assisted Farming Drone project aims to provide smallholder farmers with affordable and adaptable monitoring technology to enhance agricultural productivity, using the monitoring of grape crops in Ohio's vineyards as a case study. In partnership with OMID USA, the project addresses the limitations of traditional agricultural drones by providing a scalable solution tailored for smallholder farmers. Utilizing the MicaSense RedEdge-MX™ multispectral camera and Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB), the system integrates multispectral imaging and AI analytics to detect diseases such as downy mildew, powdery mildew, black rot, and lantern flies.
The drone focuses on a X650 Holybro Drone kit while ensuring compatibility with other farming equipment, like tractors, to maximize flexibility for farmers. The project also involved collaboration with the Control Box team to integrate stationary sensors for a comprehensive monitoring solution. The solution focuses on being simple, affordable, and flexible, supporting OMID USA’s mission to help underserved farming communities.

## Project Abstract
In this project, we will develop a wireless microclimate sensor system that is capable of sensing local climate components such as air temperature, humidity, light intensity, and wind at an agricultural site as well as the soil conditions such as soil temperature and moisture level. These sensing data will be collected remotely into an application, made accessible to the user, and will be used to make automatic decisions on the adjustment of the PV panel angle and other operations. Some extreme weather events such as hails may not be easily detected or predicted from the microclimate sensing; these will instead be reported from public alert sources.
