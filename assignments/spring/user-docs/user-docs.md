# User Documentation

## Introduction
This application is used to monitor and track local climate conditions at a given site. Currently, it is deployed alongside multiple microclimate sensor systems at an active vineyard site to monitor conditions there.

## Getting Started
Visit http://vinovoltaics.wine and log in with an authorized Google account.

## User Interface
The user interface specification can be found [here](../user-interface-specification/user-interface-specification.pdf). Below is an explanation of each functionality within the application.
### Site Selection
Select between multiple sites. A site is a geographical location. For example, one vineyard would be treated as one site.
### Date Range Selection
Select a range of time for which to display local climate data. View data over the past day, week, month, etc.
### Time Interval Selection
Select the frequency for which to display local climate data over the selected range of time. View measured data.
### Filter Selection
Filter local climate data by type of measurement (humidity, light, rainfall, etc.) and by zone (classified within the site).
### Notifications
Be alerted by the National Weather Service when local weather conditions are changing.
### Settings
Configure the timezone to show when displaying data.

# Developer Documentation

## Introduction
There are multiple steps that need to be taken as a developer to fully deploy this codebase as a working application. The steps below target deployment as a web application, but this same codebase can be built and published as a mobile or desktop application with few changes.

This application operates on the assumption that an InfluxDB Cloud time-series database has been populated with real-time sensor measurement data. More information can be found [here](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/).

## Environment
This application was developed using Flutter. We recommend using Visual Studio Code as your IDE and installing the recommended Dart and Flutter extensions: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started

## Building and Debugging
Set [this](../../../application/agrivoltaics_flutter_app/) as the root directory in Visual Studio Code to enable debugging.

In order to build and debug:
* Ensure all Flutter packages are downloaded by running ```flutter pub get```
* Populate all necessary values in [launch.json](../../../application/agrivoltaics_flutter_app/.vscode/launch.json) (see [configuration](#configuration))
* Select your target platform in the bottom right of VSCode:

![platform](./images/select-platform-flutter.png)

* Open the Run and Debug panel, select your desired launch configuration, and select Run -> Start Debugging (F5)

![run and debug](./images/run-and-debug-flutter.png)

![run and debug](./images/run-and-debug-flutter-2.png)

Flutter will automatically build and run the application on the selected platform, outputting any build or runtime errors to the debug console.

## Configuration
| Key              | Description    |
|------------------|----------------|
| INFLUXDB_URL     |  InfluxDB Cloud instance URL (ex. https://us-east-1-1.aws.cloud2.influxdata.com)              |
| INFLUXDB_TOKEN   |  InfluxDB Cloud API token with read access to desired bucket              |
| INFLUXDB_ORG     |  InfluxDB Cloud organization (ex. 11183059442b6f41)             |
| INFLUXDB_BUCKET  |  InfluxDB Cloud instance bucket name              |
| INFLUXDB_DEBUG   |  Whether to provide debugging information on the Flutter InfluxDB client(true/false)              |
| ADMIN_EMAIL      |  Email granted access to the web application for debugging purposes              |
| OWNER_EMAIL      |  Email granted access to the web application on behalf of the client              |

## Deployment
Being written in Flutter, this application can be deployed to Android, iOS, Windows, or as a web application. The following steps are only relevant to its deployment as a web application.

### GitHub Actions
Included in this repository is a [GitHub workflow](../../../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) containing several GitHub Actions. When the ```deploy``` branch is pushed, these actions build and deploy the Flutter application as a web application on [Google Cloud Platform](#google-cloud-platform) and also build and deploy supporting Python microservices found [here](../../../application/microservices/).

### GitHub Variables & Secrets
During deployment, privileged credentials and dynamic variables present in the workflow are populated by GitHub repository variables and secrets. These can be configured on the repository level under a repository's settings.

### Google Cloud Platform
A working Google Cloud Platform environment is required in order for the above deployment to work correctly. The GCP services involved in this deployment include [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and [Identity and Access Management](https://cloud.google.com/iam).
