emphasis on measuring light under canopy vs outside canopy
- LOTS OF LIGHT SENSORS
based on difference in lighting, what was the impact on the crops

maybe this will reduce ground cover?

figure out app communication with microcontroller

divide sensors into geographical regions (groups?) (instead of under canopy vs not under canopy)

must be scaleable beyond a single, binary row of vineyard

separate graphs of data for each region
