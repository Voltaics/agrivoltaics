# Individual Capstone Assessment
## Eli Rindler

Regarding my individual academics, the senior design project provides the opportunity to 
apply my skills to solve a real-world problem. This application goes beyond the technologies and 
computer knowledge I have gained over my academic career; it applies soft skills such as 
collaboration and communication as well. In my particular case, I am using this project to assist a 
non-profit that is trying to improve farming in poverty-stricken areas. In this project, I will 
develop a solution designed to assist others while enhancing my skills as a software engineer. In 
the project I am working on, I see potential for great value that can come from my team’s work. 
All in all, I believe the senior design project is an opportunity to build something tangible with 
the skills I have acquired and gain more experience in the process. 

As a student at the University of Cincinnati, I have built the foundation for my career as a 
software engineer. I learned how to think critically about computer programs in Design and 
Analysis of Algorithms (CS4071). In this class, we learned about algorithms, but more 
importantly, how to use the strategies of the algorithms to apply to your own programs. On the 
soft skill side, I improved my writing and technical communication skills in Technical and 
Scientific Writing (ENGL4092). In this class, I learned how to effectively communicate 
information depending on the audience. The critical thinking of algorithms will guide the 
development of the project through my thought processes when designing our systems. The 
knowledge gained from technical writing will be used when communicating with teammates and 
writing documentation. These were just two examples of how my academic experience will 
guide the development of the project, but they give an idea of the scope of my learning that will 
be utilized. 

I spent all of my co-ops as an IT Software Development Co-op at Midmark Corporation 
in Versailles, Ohio. Doing this software development work built my skills in teaching myself 
technical tools. In my co-ops, I was given many opportunities and oftentimes needed to learn 
new technologies. These experiences taught me how to quickly pick up a new tool and apply it to 
solve a problem for the business. I plan to use this to guide the development of the project 
because I will need to use technical tools to solve our intended problem, and learning will be an 
essential part of that. A non-technical skill I picked up as a co-op was presenting technical 
information to non-technical audiences. This was done through many presentations with 
stakeholders and other individuals who were not familiar with the technical details of the project. 
I plan to apply this skill whenever I need to report out on the status of the project. These two 
skills are just a drop in the bucket of the many skills I plan to apply that I picked up on co-op. 

I am motivated for this project because it is an opportunity to help others using the skills I 
have acquired over my professional career so far. The non-profit, OMID USA, is intended to 
create a drone that has a camera attached to it that goes through fields and scans the plants 
looking for those that need fertilizer. An AI model then takes the images from the camera on the 
drone, determines what areas in the field need fertilizer, and displays that on the app for the 
farmer. This will benefit those in poverty-stricken areas because, with these tools, they will be 
able to use their fertilizer more effectively by applying it only where it is needed. This gets me 
excited about the project because it is an opportunity to save resources and have more effective 
farming. This will lead to more food for those who need it and less damage to the environment 
caused by the overutilization of fertilizer. 

My preliminary approach to designing a solution will involve learning the user 
requirements through speaking with stakeholders. I will try to refine these requirements into 
actionable steps that I can take during development to achieve the desired solution. Our expected 
results are to create a machine learning model that takes video from crops in a field and 
determines which areas need pesticide. The expected results are an accurate machine learning 
model and an application that displays to the farmer which areas in their farm need pesticide. I 
will self-evaluate my contributions through proactively looking at the project as a whole and 
seeing how my contributions map to the current product and how they get us closer to the goal 
product. I will know when I am done when the machine learning model and application are 
finished, accurate, and satisfy stakeholders. In order to know I have done a good job, we should 
have satisfied those requirements.
