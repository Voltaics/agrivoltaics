# Individual Capstone Assessment
## Huy Nguyen

I think my Senior Design project is a chance to build a capstone assessment to reflect and
improve my academic and software engineering skills I’ve gained over the 5-year courses. It’s a
chance for me to show what I’ve learned throughout my career as a coop and a student. This is also
a great opportunity for me to learn new things and network with fellow students for additional
networks that might be helpful for full-time job search. I will be working with different things that
I’ve never experienced before so it’s going to be a great learning opportunity. And after building this
capstone project, we will have a chance to show off our work at CEAS EXPO. This is a great chance
to network with more people such as students and potential employers who might be interested in
hiring students at the time.

I believe the Computer Science courses I’ve taken in the past will help me achieve the
project’s requirements. With Software Engineering (EECE3093C) course potentially being the most
important aspect of driving project success, it will be applied to guide us in every project
development stage. As I’ve completed the courses of building an EV3 in ENED1100 and ENED 1120,
it will help me better understand how robot works. This project is about building a drone, which is
kind of similar to an EV3, and I believe the experience I got as a main coder of my ENED team helps
prepare me better in testing the drone as I’ve done a lot of tests when coding for an EV3. Besides
that, the courses of Algorithms (CS4071) and Artificial Intelligent (CS4033) also support me with the
foundations that will help me better understand these concepts to drive the development of the
drone. Overall, I will utilize most of the courses mentioned above to collaborate better with my
teammates.

I also had 5 coop experiences in interning with Siemens as a Software Engineering Intern so
these basics will contribute to my project implementations. I have joined 2 teams, which brought
me a good number of hands-on experiences within Siemens, to work on different projects and
internal tools. As I have all 5 coop semesters working with Git (version control) and Gitlab, it will
help me significantly in guiding the project development in the right direction and group working as
we contribute to implement it throughout 2-semesters course. I also have experience working as a
full-stack engineer in both front-end and back-end so I can best contribute to building the model to
detect defects for the drone. I also improved my communication and teamwork abilities which I will
utilize to make sure that my team stays on track and solve miscommunication problems (if any)
during the development process. By making a ton of mistakes during coop experiences, I acquired a
great deal of problem-solving skills including problem detection at the earlier stage in project
development that I believe will add value to the success of my project.

For this capstone, I’ll be focusing on making a drone that utilizes AI image and video
processing features to optimize pesticide application in farming. For me personally, building a
drone is one of my dreams as a kid. I’ve always dreamed of making some robots and things that fly
in the sky. That was the biggest aspect that jumps start my motivation to drive this project to
success. So, I promise myself that I will keep that motivation to build a fine version of defect
detection mechanism for the drone as well as to bring the solution to the table for Siemens to
recognize our hard work. I’m so thrilled and excited to kick start this project next week and come to
the harvesting event this weekend to learn more about what drone features farmers want to help
support their farming journey.

We will establish the group check-ins once a week, so everyone gets a chance to meet and
update on the project’s progress. We also had some thoughts on building an AI model but I’m not
really sure how the model will structure so I’ll get on that with my team in the next couple weeks. I
expect that the drone will be capable of analyzing the data to determine when and which crops
require spraying, and the results are displayed in an application. So, I would think that we might
need to build an interface for capturing data and make the drone produce some sort of solutions
that reduce costs and improve crop health. As of now, I’m not sure what is good enough for the
drone, but I’d think that whenever we got the working solutions as described above, we somehow
have reached most of the requirements. And I’ll also continue to reach out for my mentor to receive
feedback on the drone progress weekly to keep track of the goals and that will ultimately drive us to
finish flashily.
