# Individual Capstone Assessment
## Amogh Silaparasetti

The senior design project I’ll be working on is OMID USA AI Farming Drone with Dr. Mohsen
Rezayat as our advisor. In this project, we will be developing a video/image AI that will help
us in determining when and which crops need to be treated with pesticides with potentially
other factors in consideration as well. We will be using cameras attached to drones and
other equipment that sends the images/video of the crops to the cloud which is then sent
to the AI Model.

There are some courses which will be helpful for this project. Currently I’m taking
Intelligent Systems (Fall 2025) which will give me an idea on how we can develop our AI
Model and Deep Learning (Fall 2025) where I can use the concepts in training the AI Model
in improving its accuracy. I’m also currently taking User Interface (Fall 2025) where the
concepts can be used to create a user friendly and smooth UI of the app that will be used
to control.

I have also learned a lot of skills during my co-op at Swingtech (2022-2023) and Siemens
(2024-2025). During my time at siemens, I have learned how to create a web application
and implement UI that will call the functions on the back end. And at my time at siemens, I
have learned how to create functions and adjust them such that the AI can call that
function when needed based on the task/prompt it has been provided with.

I’m motivated to work on this project as this project as this is my first project where I get to
work on an agriculture related problem. I would also get to learn more skills and refine my
current skills as well. As for contributions, I would ensure that my top priority would be to
get my tasks done efficiently along with getting them on time. I would also make sure to
take equal share of tasks and help my teammates in any possible.

For my preliminary approach, I would first get a deep look into problem, looking at the field
in-person, what factors need to be considered, and current equipment. I would also get up
to speed with the seniors who worked on this project. As for the expected results, the goal
would be to have an app that will be user friendly for the users to control the pesticides and
the AI model would have an accuracy of 70% or more based on the data retrieved.
