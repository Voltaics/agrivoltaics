# Individual Capstone Assessment
## Ayushi Sharma
My senior design project focuses on developing a drone-based system capable of detecting early signs of crop disease using machine learning and computer vision. From my individual academic perspective, the project embodies the intersection of intelligent systems, automation, and real-world problem solving, all of which have been central themes in my coursework and research. The overall objective is to use a drone equipped with a camera to survey farmland and identify areas that may be at risk for disease so that farmers can take preemptive action. Our team will analyze factors such as leaf coloration, texture changes, lesions on plant surfaces, and other visual markers correlated with disease. By integrating aerial imaging with a predictive model, we aim to provide farmers with reliable, fast, and cost-effective insights. Ultimately, this project allows me to apply my technical background to an environmentally meaningful challenge.

My college curriculum has strongly prepared me for this effort, particularly through advanced courses that built my technical foundation. In Deep Learning (CS 5173), I gained experience with convolutional neural networks, data preprocessing, and model evaluation—all concepts that directly support our disease-detection pipeline. I also learned how to perform hyperparameter tuning, analyze model behavior, and manage large datasets, which will be essential as we experiment with different architectures. In Software Engineering (EECE 3093C), I learned principles of system design, modular development, and documentation, which will guide the structuring of our full drone-analysis system. These courses also strengthened my communication and teamwork skills through group projects, code reviews, and iterative development cycles. Together, these academic experiences have shaped both my technical proficiency and my ability to collaborate effectively on a long-term engineering project.

My experiential learning outside the classroom has further prepared me for the complexities of this project. My research in reinforcement learning taught me how to design experiments, evaluate model performance, and iterate quickly based on results—skills that will translate well when testing different machine-learning approaches for disease detection. In my computer vision–focused co-op, I worked directly with image-based models and real-world data imperfections, gaining practical knowledge about dataset cleaning, annotation, and evaluation metrics. I also developed professional communication skills by presenting findings, documenting progress, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. These experiences taught me to approach technical challenges systematically while staying adaptable to unexpected obstacles. As a result, I feel better equipped to contribute to both the software and practical deployment sides of our senior design project.

I am highly motivated to work on this project because it combines meaningful environmental impact with the technical areas I find most exciting. The idea of using machine learning and aerial robotics to support sustainable agriculture is both intellectually stimulating and socially beneficial. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of designing models capable of accurately detecting subtle visual patterns associated with plant disease. My preliminary approach involves gathering publicly available agricultural datasets, augmenting them with additional drone-captured images, and experimenting with different deep-learning architectures to determine which performs best. I also hope to refine the system through iterative testing, continuously improving accuracy as we collect more field data. This problem aligns closely with my academic interests and offers me the chance to create something impactful.

In the final stage of the project, my focus will shift toward ensuring the solution is reliable, practical, and ready for real-world deployment. Our expected accomplishment is a functional drone system capable of capturing high-quality aerial images and producing accurate predictions about disease-risk areas in farmland. I will evaluate my own contributions by assessing whether the machine-learning pipeline I develop is well-documented, reproducible, and consistently accurate across multiple field tests. A key measure of success will be whether the system performs well during live demonstrations and whether farmers or stakeholders find the insights understandable and useful. I will also reflect on how effectively I collaborated with teammates, communicated progress, and incorporated feedback throughout the design process. Ultimately, I will know I have done a good job if both the technical accuracy and practical usability of the system meet or exceed our project goals.
