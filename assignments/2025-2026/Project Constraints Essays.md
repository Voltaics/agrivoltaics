The project involves using drones and sensors to collect agricultural data and train machine learning models to predict plant illness and optimize pesticide use.  
 
Security constraints: Since the project will be deployed in real-world farms, data collection will need to respect farmers’ privacy and property rights. The use of drone surveillance might raise concerns about data misuse, so data security measures will be implemented.  
 
Legal constraints: We need to follow aviation and drone operation regulations, as well as data protection laws governing sensor and video data collection. Additionally, our project will only use open-source software, programming libraries, and machine learning frameworks to avoid intellectual property disputes.  
 
Social constraints: The project is intended to benefit farmers and agricultural communities by improving crop yields and reducing pesticide use. It can also contribute to sustainable farming practices, indirectly enhancing quality of life.  
 
Environmental constraints: The project aims to reduce the overuse of pesticides and fertilizers by identifying only affected areas, thereby minimizing soil and water contamination. However, environmental conditions vary widely across regions and crops, so the solution will require fine-tuning before individual deployments are made.  

Economic Constraints; The project is open source and is ideally available to all, with minimal cost to the user. Following this, we should attempt to make the solution inexpensive for the user while maintaining quality.
